# CTEs-in-SQL
In SQL, CTEs stand for Common Table Expressions.

Here's a breakdown:

1. What they are: CTEs are temporary named result sets that you define within the scope of a single SQL statement. They act like temporary tables that exist only for the duration of that   
   specific query.
2. How they work: You define a CTE using the WITH clause, followed by the name of the CTE and a SELECT statement that defines the data for that CTE.

Benefits:
1. Improved Readability: CTEs make complex queries more readable and easier to understand by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts.
   Modularity: CTEs promote modularity by allowing you to define reusable subqueries.
2. Simplified Logic: They can simplify complex logic, especially when dealing with hierarchical data or recursive queries.This CTE can then be referenced in subsequent parts of the same 
   SQL statement.
